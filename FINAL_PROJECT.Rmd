#Statistical Interpretation and Summary
#In this study, we aimed to differentiate between Tremor-Dominant (TD) and Postural Instability Gait Disorder (PIGD) phenotypes of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using various clinical, psychological, cognitive, and dual-task performance features. After data imputation using Predictive Mean Matching (via mice) and filtering relevant features, we applied three classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, and evaluated them using ROC curves and 10-fold cross-validation.

#Model Comparison:
#Logistic Regression:
#Accuracy: 85.7%, Sensitivity (TD detection): 100% , Specificity (PIGD detection): 75% ,Cross-Validated Mean ROC: 0.4625

#Despite high accuracy on the test set, logistic regression showed convergence warnings and unstable probability estimates (fitted values close to 0 or 1), indicating overfitting and poor generalizability.

#Random Forest: 
#Accuracy: 42.8% , Sensitivity: 0%  , Specificity: 75%,  Cross-Validated Mean ROC: 0.675

#While performance on the test set was weak, cross-validation suggests that with more data, RF may generalize well. It also achieved perfect specificity in several folds, indicating strong ability to detect PIGD when trained properly.

#Naive Bayes:
#Accuracy: 71.4% , Sensitivity: 66.7%,  Specificity: 75%,  Cross-Validated Mean ROC: 0.675

#Performed well both on the test set and in cross-validation, with balanced sensitivity and specificity, making it a practical choice for small datasets.

#Key Observations:
#ROC analysis shows Naive Bayes and Random Forest consistently outperformed logistic regression in terms of discriminative power (ROC).

#Naive Bayes showed the most balanced performance across all metrics and folds, making it the most stable model under limited sample size.

#Logistic Regressionâ€™s instability is likely due to multicollinearity or insufficient events per variable (EPV).

#Final Recommendation:
#Based on this analysis, Naive Bayes is the most robust model for distinguishing TD vs. PIGD in this dataset due to its balance, generalizability (cross-validation ROC), and stable performance. Random Forest may perform better with a larger dataset, and its high specificity makes it useful for clinical decision-making when PIGD identification is critical.

#Interpretation 
#This shows that non-motor featuresâ€”including psychological distress and cognitive impairmentâ€”can help differentiate between TD and PIGD phenotypes. Phenotype classification using predictive modeling is feasible and may aid clinical assessments.

# AIM 2: Predicting Phenotype Ratio Using Cognitive, Psychological, and DT Variables

#In this analysis, we investigated whether cognitive, psychological, and dual-task (DT) performance variables could explain variation in the phenotype ratio (tremor/PIGD) in individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. This continuous ratio reflects severity along the TDâ€“PIGD phenotype spectrum.

#After imputing missing values using Predictive Mean Matching (via the `mice` package) and selecting relevant features, we fit a multiple linear regression model using `phenotype_ration_tremor_pi` as the outcome. The model included cognitive scores (MMSE, Trails A & B, SDMT), psychological measures (ABC, mFFABQ, PAS, GDS), DT effects (mdte, cogdt, cdte, maai), and covariates (age, sex, HY stage).

## Model Performance : Adjusted RÂ²: 0.63 , RMSE (Test set): 1.29 , MAE: 1.09, F(18,39) = 6.43, p < 0.001

#The model explained ~75% of the variance in phenotype ratio on the full data and ~55% on held-out test data, indicating strong explanatory power and moderate generalizability.

## Significant Predictors
# Persistent Anxiety (PAS-A) (p < 0.001): Higher scores associated with increased tremor dominance.
# Depression (GDS) (p < 0.001): Higher depressive symptoms associated with lower phenotype ratio (more PIGD).
# Balance Discordance (p < 0.001): Overestimating balance ability associated with tremor dominance.
#ABC Balance Confidence (p < 0.001): Higher confidence predicted lower tremor dominance.
# HY Stage (p < 0.01): Greater motor severity correlated with higher phenotype ratio.
# Sex (p < 0.05): Females showed higher phenotype ratio than males.
# Trails B Time (p < 0.05): Better executive function (faster times) predicted higher tremor dominance.

## Interpretation
#Psychological and perceptual variables â€” particularly anxiety, balance self-perception, and depression â€” significantly explain where a patient lies along the tremor vs. PIGD spectrum. Traditional cognitive measures (e.g., MMSE, SDMT) were not significant predictors in this model. This highlights the potential clinical value of non-motor symptoms in characterizing Parkinson's phenotype severity.

## Conclusion
#This analysis supports the use of psychological and DT-related metrics in understanding and modeling phenotype severity. Targeted interventions for anxiety and balance misperception may be especially relevant in tremor-dominant patients.
