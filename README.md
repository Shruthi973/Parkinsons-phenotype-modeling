# ðŸ§  Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Phenotype Modeling â€“ Subtype Classification & Severity Prediction

This clinical machine learning project explores the classification of Parkinson's Disease patients into two motor subtypesâ€”Tremor Dominant (TD) vs. Postural Instability and Gait Disorder (PIGD)â€”and models a continuous severity ratio using psychological, cognitive, and balance-related variables.

## ðŸ§ª Dataset
- Source: Real-world clinical study data (`DATA.csv`)
- 144 features â†’ motor scores, cognitive test results, balance confidence, fear of falling, mood assessments, dual-tasking performance
- Target variables:
  - `phenotype` (1 = TD, 2 = PIGD)
  - `phenotype_ratio` (continuous: tremor/pigd dominance)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
1. **Classify** phenotype groups using:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Naive Bayes
   - Random Forest

2. **Predict** phenotype ratio using:
   - Linear Regression
   - Feature scaling and imputation

## ðŸ”§ Methods
- Imputation: `IterativeImputer` (PMM-style)
- Stratified Train-Test Split
- Standardization with `StandardScaler`
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Recall, Confusion Matrix, RÂ², RMSE, MAE

## ðŸ§  Results Summary

### âœ… Classification
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 75%
- **Naive Bayes Balanced Accuracy**: 75%
- **Random Forest**: High specificity but lower sensitivity to TD group

### ðŸ“ˆ Regression
- **Adjusted RÂ²**: 0.555
- **Key Predictors**: Anxiety, Depression, Balance Discordance, HY Stage
- **RMSE**: 1.14, **MAE**: 0.91
